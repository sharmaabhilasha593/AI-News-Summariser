      content: `Last week, news broke that James Dean will star in a new movie—64 years after his death. 
A production company called Magic City got the rights to Dean’s image from the late actor’s estate and plans to bring him to the silver screen again thanks to the wonder (or terror) of CGI.

Now, Dean, or the digitally resurrected version of Dean or whatever, will play the second lead in a Vietnam War movie called Finding Jack, with a living actor standing in as his voice.

Unsurprisingly, the announcement inspired a wave of immediate backlash around Hollywood. Chris Evans called it “awful” and “shameful,” and Elijah Wood said, simply, “NOPE.” 
But it turns out the intense reaction was surprising to at least one person: Magic City’s Anton Ernst, the Finding Jack director.

Ernst told the Hollywood Reporter in a new interview that he’s gotten “positive feedback” about the movie and that the Dean estate has been “supportive,” saying it will inspire “a whole new generation of filmgoers to be aware of James Dean.”`,

The S&P 500 surged 2.4%, marking its best weekly gain in months.

Investors are optimistic that central banks may begin easing interest rates by mid-2026, after two years of aggressive monetary tightening. 
Energy prices have stabilized, supply chain pressures have eased, and consumer demand remains resilient despite slower wage growth.

However, analysts caution that geopolitical uncertainties — particularly the ongoing trade tensions between the US and China — could still disrupt global growth. 
Emerging markets like India and Vietnam continue to attract significant foreign investment due to their stable inflation rates and booming digital economies.`,

      content: `The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced the launch of its digital rupee pilot program, aimed at streamlining interbank transactions. 
The initiative allows select banks to use central bank digital currency (CBDC) for real-time settlements of government securities.

According to the RBI, this move will reduce settlement risk, improve transparency, and lower transaction costs. 
Officials also revealed that a retail version is under development for consumer payments in select cities.

Experts believe the digital rupee will complement, not replace, existing digital payment systems like UPI. 
India’s experiment is being closely watched by other nations exploring their own CBDCs, including Japan, Brazil, and the European Union.`,

      summary:"Technology has revolutionized the way education is delivered in the 21st century. From traditional classrooms to online learning platforms, the integration of digital tools has transformed teaching and learning processes. Students now have access to an unprecedented amount of information, allowing them to explore subjects in greater depth and at their own pace. Unlike the rigid, lecture-based models of the past, modern education emphasizes interactive learning, collaboration, and critical thinking. Teachers can now leverage multimedia presentations, online assessments, and virtual simulations to create a more engaging and comprehensive learning experience."

                India beat Pakistan by five wickets in a tense final to retain the Asia Cup at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.
                It was the third meeting between the rivals at the tournament and success for India earned them a ninth title.
                Both sides again refused to shake hands - as they had in the two earlier fractious encounters.
                The India players sat on the outfield when the winners' trophy was due to be presented, with Indian cricket board (BCCI) secretary Devajit Saikia later saying they had refused to accept it from Asian Cricket Council president Mohsin Naqvi.
                Naqvi is also the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board.
                India captain Suryakumar Yadav said: "It's one thing that I have never seen in my career, that a champion team is denied its trophy.

                "We took the call on the ground about not taking the trophy."

                In the absence of the trophy presentation, India's players instead celebrated retaining their crown by mimicking holding a trophy.

                "I think what has happened in this tournament is very disappointing," Pakistan captain Salman Agha said.
                "If they think they disrespected us by not shaking hands, then I say they disrespected cricket.

                India and Pakistan engaged in a four-day military conflict in April following a deadly militant attack on tourists in India-administered Kashmir.
                Even before that conflict, the cricket teams would only face each other at neutral venues and in worldwide competitions.
                Made to bat first, Pakistan started superbly, with Sahibzada Farhan (57) and Fakhar Zaman (46) putting together an impressive opening stand of 84.
                They rallied to 113-1 with 44 balls left in the innings, but the collapse that followed would be dramatic and prove pivotal to the outcome.
                With the help of left-arm spinner Kuldeep Yadav (4-30) and some poor shots, India took the remaining nine wickets for just 33 runs as a shellshocked Pakistan were bundled out for 146 with five deliveries still left in their innings.
                India themselves started badly in their reply and lost three wickets in the opening three overs to give Pakistan hope.
                But Tilak Varma calmed things down with a fine unbeaten 69, while Shivam Dube (33) and Sanju Samson (24) provided much-needed support as they triumphed with two balls left.

                "It is one of the best innings of my life," said Tilak. "It was a bit pressured, but I wanted to stay in and finish the game."`,

                Pakistan 146 (19.1 overs): S Farhan 57 (38); K Yadav 4-30

                India 150-5 (19.4 overs): Tilak 69* (53); Faheem 3-29

                India beat Pakistan by five wickets in a tense final to retain the Asia Cup at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.
                It was the third meeting between the rivals at the tournament and success for India earned them a ninth title.
                Both sides again refused to shake hands - as they had in the two earlier fractious encounters.
                The India players sat on the outfield when the winners' trophy was due to be presented, with Indian cricket board (BCCI) secretary Devajit Saikia later saying they had refused to accept it from Asian Cricket Council president Mohsin Naqvi.
                Naqvi is also the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board.
                India captain Suryakumar Yadav said: "It's one thing that I have never seen in my career, that a champion team is denied its trophy.

                "We took the call on the ground about not taking the trophy."

                In the absence of the trophy presentation, India's players instead celebrated retaining their crown by mimicking holding a trophy.

                "I think what has happened in this tournament is very disappointing," Pakistan captain Salman Agha said.
                "If they think they disrespected us by not shaking hands, then I say they disrespected cricket.

                India and Pakistan engaged in a four-day military conflict in April following a deadly militant attack on tourists in India-administered Kashmir.
                Even before that conflict, the cricket teams would only face each other at neutral venues and in worldwide competitions.
                Made to bat first, Pakistan started superbly, with Sahibzada Farhan (57) and Fakhar Zaman (46) putting together an impressive opening stand of 84.
                They rallied to 113-1 with 44 balls left in the innings, but the collapse that followed would be dramatic and prove pivotal to the outcome.
                With the help of left-arm spinner Kuldeep Yadav (4-30) and some poor shots, India took the remaining nine wickets for just 33 runs as a shellshocked Pakistan were bundled out for 146 with five deliveries still left in their innings.
                India themselves started badly in their reply and lost three wickets in the opening three overs to give Pakistan hope.
                But Tilak Varma calmed things down with a fine unbeaten 69, while Shivam Dube (33) and Sanju Samson (24) provided much-needed support as they triumphed with two balls left.

                "It is one of the best innings of my life," said Tilak. "It was a bit pressured, but I wanted to stay in and finish the game."`,
